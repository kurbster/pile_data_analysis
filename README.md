## How to Run
This code was tested with `python==3.8` so we recommend creating your virtual environment with that python version.

Run the code from the main directory with the following command `python -m src.main`. This code uses the `main.yaml` file
defined in the `conf` directory. To specify different config options follow the [hydra documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/).
